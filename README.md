# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game project! This simple console-based game allows you to play Tic Tac Toe against another player. It's written in Python(Programming language) and utilizes basic game logic with while loops to manage turns and conditions for ending the game.

## Features

- **Help**: Provides instructions on how to play the game.
- **Quit**: Allows you to exit the program at any time.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects if a player has won.
- **Full Board Detection**: Checks if all tiles are filled, resulting in a draw.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git`.
   
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: `cd` into the project directory.

3. **Run the Game**: Execute the game using your terminal window by running the code.

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: Follow the prompts to input your moves and play the game.

## Implementation Details

- The game uses while loops (`while(true)`) to keep the game running until a win or draw condition is met.
- Empty set is used to track and prevent players from selecting the same tile more than once.
- Win detection is implemented to check for three consecutive tiles in a row, column, or diagonal.
- The game checks for a draw condition by verifying if all tiles are filled without a winner.
